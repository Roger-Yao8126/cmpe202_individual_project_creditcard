#Part2:  15 points (Design only)
- Continue with the design from Part 1 and extend it to parse different input file formats (json, xml, csv) and detect the type of credit card and then output (in the same format as input) - into another file - with each line showing the card number, type of card (if a valid card number) and an error (if the card number is not valid). The design should accommodate newer file formats for the future.

#Part 3: 60 points
- Implement an application (Java code and JUnit tests) for Part 1 and Part2 - that accepts input file name and output file name and writes an output file in the same format as the input (CSV or JSON or XML). Output should contain the details specified in Part 2.
Submit design and code in the github repo (classroom invite will be sent by grader)
Grader will provide sample JUnit formats and input file formats
